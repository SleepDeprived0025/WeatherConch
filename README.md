# Weather Conch

A website to quickly check the weather in any location using [OpenWeather Api](https://openweathermap.org/). This was a project mainly for me to practice working with Api and understanding data in JSON.
The website will tell you the current temperature, what it feels like and the weather description for the location you've provided.

## This was built with
- Node
- Express
- EJS
- Axios


## To view the project **locally**:

1. Clone it and install all the necessary node modules

```

git clone https://github.com/SleepDeprived0025/WeatherConch.git
npm i

```

2. Host it locally

```

node .\index.js

```
3. View the website at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
